### Syllable structure

( h (C)) V (N)

* C: Any consonant
* V: Any vowel

### Prosody

Stress usually falls on the second to last syllable, unless the word ends in a nasal vowel or preaspirates suffixes, in which case it falls on the last syllable. 

## Syntax

### Main clause

Proto-Hakean primarily a VSO language, though noun fronting is a common strategy to mark indefinite nouns and actors that are being introduced to the universe of discourse. Resulting in common SVO, OVS and SOV word orders.


### The verb phrase

The verb phrase is, maximally, as follows:

(Preposition) **Verb** (Adverbs) (Aux_Verb)

Preverbal adpositions are valency increasing operators. These are ussually applied before intransitive verbs to have them take a locative object, though they might also serve to form dative or causative constructions. Only a small subset of adpositions is allowed in this role.

The order of adverbs is time -- manner -- place.

Auxiliary verbs are primarily used as aspect markers.
